# pgmq-migration and pgmq-config are all 0.5.0.0 -- recorded without the tag
# prefix. pgmq-bench is deliberately excluded: it is Visibility.Internal, is not
# in the pgmq-hs bundle, and carries its own 0.1.0.0. That matches
# shinzui/kioku, shinzui/baikai, shinzui/shikumi and shinzui/keiro, whose facts
# are also bare versions. Versions are opaque to mori -- it never parses or
# compares them -- so nothing but this line enforces that.
